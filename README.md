# libLitePCIe

This is my effort to create build scripts and packaging to make the kernel and userspace drivers of the [litePCIe](https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litepcie) FPGA core easier to use and keep consistent once installed. All actual driver code is by Florent [Enjoy Digital](https://github.com/enjoy-digital) and the contributors to that project.
